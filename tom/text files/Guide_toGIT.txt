This Package is for explaining how to use Github and push/pull 
cause i'm an idiot and will forget.

[Pulling]--
cd ros2_ws/src/waitforme
git fetch
git pull origin main

[Pushing]-- Note: make usre you pull before pushing
cd ros2_ws/src/waitforme
git add .
git commit -m "Describe the changes you've made"
git push origin main

other notes:
can use git pull/push without including origin main. may cause issues.

[Troubleshooting]--
git status

 
[Colcon building and ignoring packages]--
sometimes certain packages cause problems.
When colcon building from ros2_ws can use the suffix: 
--packages-ignore <package_name>
eg: colcon build --packages-ignore hallie

[Colcon building only certain packages]--
When colcon building from ros2_ws can use the suffix: 
--packages-select <package_name>
eg: colcon build --packages-select Tom
