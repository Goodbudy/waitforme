ok so this is most definitly just for me to understand how this stuff works
but it's also so anyone else can stare in abject horror at what i don't know
and question how i've made it this far.
Oh also has the commands and stuff to you know. run the nodes or whatever they are

Step 1: How to run (aka: run environment)
Terminal 1- launch world
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py

Terminal 2- launch map (aka: rviz nav2 map thingy)
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py use_sim_time:=True map:=$HOME/ros2_ws/src/waitforme/tom/turtle_map2.yaml

Terminal 3- Run node
ros2 run tom localisation_node


ok now for me to explain to myself how and where and why this all works
THE FOLDER NAME IS NOT THE PACKAGE NAME
package.xml sets up package name
this is again referrenced in the CMakeList.

NODE NAME
2 types. 1 is what i call when actually spinning up the node
aka localisation_node. This is set in the CMakeList. this is the executable name
The other is the one displayed when i run:
ros2 node list
for now this says "auto_localise" and this is set in the localisation.cpp file.
this is the Ros2 node name and what needs to be called by other nodes.

TOPIC NAME
this is the /initialpose which is published.
note: with the current code we just publish a known starting position to the topic to initialise

OpenCV Testing
https://chatgpt.com/share/68073b60-c720-800d-ae9b-3ce5694872ea
the first section of this chat has the guide to install and test opencv
note: need to be in ros2_ws/src/waitforme/tom/src to run
