ok so this is most definitly just for me to understand how this stuff works
but it's also so anyone else can stare in abject horror at what i don't know
and question how i've made it this far.
Oh also has the commands and stuff to you know. run the nodes or whatever they are

1. Run your environment
2. run your rviz nav2 map thingy. -see [Navigation with Ros2] in Guide_toTurtle
3. run the following:
ros2 run tom localization_node



ok now for me to explain to myself how and where and why this all works
THE FOLDER NAME IS NOT THE PACKAGE NAME
package.xml sets up package name
this is again referrenced in the CMakeList.

NODE NAME
2 types. 1 is what i call when actually spinning up the node
aka localization_node. This is set in the CMakeList. this is the executable name
The other is the one displayed when i run:
ros2 node list
for now this says "auto_localise" and this is set in the localization.cpp file.
this is the Ros2 node name and what needs to be called by other nodes.

TOPIC NAME
this is the /initialpose which is published.
