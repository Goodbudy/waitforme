launching in sim:

  How many robots?
    in gazebo_multi_nav2_world.launch.py
    robots = [
        {'name': 'tb1', 'x_pose': '3.0', 'y_pose': '3.0'},
        {'name': 'tb2', 'x_pose': '2.9', 'y_pose': '1.6'},
        # add more robots here
    ]
    
  When ready to launch run:
    ros2 launch turtlebot3_multi_robot gazebo_multi_nav2_world.launch.py

  Sending gaols:
    - you can run pre made utests from my package:
      ros2 run turtlebot3_multi_robot Utest_single_goal_distribution
        Sends a single goal to each robot
      ros2 run turtlebot3_multi_robot Utest_goal_reassignment
        Sends multiple goals to only tb1 to test status and its impact on goal reassignment
      MOST RELEVANT FOR INTEGRATION
      ros2 run turtlebot3_multi_robot Utest_optimized_goal_assignment
        Sends 4 goals to goal manager who distributes the goals to any the avaible turtlebots based on the status of their states
    - Use the client action service to send a goal yourself:
      ros2 service call /add_goal issy/srv/AddGoal "{x: 2.0, y: 2.2}"
